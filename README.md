ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model in Python to predict stock prices based on historical data. It covers the entire pipeline â€” from data collection and preprocessing using pandas and scikit-learn, to model training and evaluation using regression techniques. The model is visualized with matplotlib and seaborn, showcasing trends in closing prices and prediction accuracy.
